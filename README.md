## What's hack day?
Hack day is a magical quarterly (or semi-annual) time where developers, designers, product people, and journalists at the Boston Globe get to work on whatever they want, for a day or two. At the end of Hack Day, the participants present their project to the rest of the group. The best projects often go on to be worked on as a regular part of our roadmap.
